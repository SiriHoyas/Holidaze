# Holidaze

Holidaze is a venue-booking site built with React and MUI with Noroffs internal API.

## Description

The goal of this project is to develop a front-end for a venue booking site called Holidaze. While the required features are defined, the design and user experience are left open-ended, providing the freedom to plan, design, and build a modern application that meets the needs of both customers and administrators.

The application consists of two main components: the customer-facing side, where users can browse and book holidays at various venues, and the admin-facing side, where registered users can manage venues and bookings.
The project uses Noroffs internal API.
